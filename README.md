Telephone Number Validator

This is a project from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification on freeCodeCamp
.
The goal of this project is to build a JavaScript program that validates US telephone numbers based on specific format rules.

📝 Project Description

The validator checks whether a given string is a valid US phone number.
It supports multiple correct formats, such as:

555-555-5555

(555)555-5555

(555) 555-5555

555 555 5555

5555555555

1 555 555 5555

and rejects invalid ones.

The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

index.html → The structure of the page (input, buttons, output).

styles.css → The styling of the app.

script.js → The core validation logic using regular expressions.

🎯 Why I built this

I created this project as part of my journey to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification.
It allowed me to practice:

Working with regular expressions in JavaScript.

Validating user input.

Building small projects that combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project helped me reinforce my problem-solving and algorithm skills.

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telephone-number-validator.git


Open index.html in your browser.

Enter a number in the input field and test the validator.
